          <h2>A Brief Synopsis of the Characters</h2>
        </p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>The Endless</th>
                    <th>A Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Morpheus</td>
                    <td>One of the seven Endless, inconceivably powerful beings older and greater than gods, 
                        Dream is both lord and personification of all dreams and stories, all that is not in reality  
                        (which, in turn, Dream may define by his existence). He has taken many names, including Morpheus and Oneiros, 
                        and his appearance can change depending on the person who is seeing him.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Death</td>
                    <td>In the DC Universe continuity, Death is both the end of life and a psychopomp. Like most anthropomorphic 
                        personifications of death, Death meets with the recently deceased and guides them into their new existence. 
                        However, unlike most personifications of death, she also visits people as they are born. Physically, Death is 
                        also opposite to the traditional western culture personification of death. In The Sandman, Death instead appears 
                        as an attractive, pale goth girl dressed in casual clothes — often a black top and jeans. She also wears a silver 
                        ankh on a chain around her neck, and has a marking similar to the eye of Horus around her right eye. She is pleasant, 
                        down-to-earth, perky, and has been a nurturing figure for both incarnations of Dream.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Destiny</td>
                    <td>The oldest of the Endless, Destiny appears as a blind man dressed in grey or brown robes (purple in earlier comics), 
                        carrying a large book, the Cosmic Log. The book is chained to him, or he is chained to the book, and within the book 
                        is written the entire sum of existence, past, present and future. Destiny seems the most possessed by his function and 
                        responsibilities of any of the Endless. He rarely demonstrates much personality. His sigil is his book. His speech appears 
                        as a regular word balloon with letters in italics. In his garden are paths souls walk along as they fulfill their lives.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Destruction</td>
                    <td>A very large, robust man with red hair, who sometimes appears bearded and sometimes shaven. Destruction abandoned his duties as 
                        one of the Endless three hundred years ago, causing much conflict between him and his siblings. He did so out of a refusal to be 
                        responsible for the scientific destruction following the enlightenment. Since abandoning his realm, the other Endless usually refer 
                        to him as "the Prodigal" or "Brother" rather than "Destruction". He has a passion for creative and constructive endeavors, but little 
                        talent. His sigil is a sword. His text is normal, but is in a balloon with a bold outline.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Desire</td>
                    <td>Desire is androgynous, capable of appearing as a man, a woman, neither, or possibly both (in the epilogue of The Sandman: Overture, 
                        Despair refers to Desire as "sister-brother"; in Season of Mists, Dream refers to Desire as “sibling”). Desire has a cruel streak and 
                        a long-standing rivalry with Dream, their relationship deteriorating eons ago after Desire caused Dream to fall in love with a woman who 
                        ultimately left him for another. Their sigil is a silver-tinted glass heart shape and they live in a huge flesh-and-blood statue of themself 
                        called The Threshold. Although Desire is Despair's twin, in a sense they are older than Despair. The current incarnation of Desire is the 
                        original one, while Despair is currently in her second incarnation. Desire's text is defined by a specific letter style in a normal balloon. 
                        In 2017, Gaiman stated that he decided to switch to using singular they pronouns to refer to Desire's, replacing his earlier use of "it" and "its".</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Despair</td>
                    <td>A short, obese woman with greyish skin and irregularly-shaped teeth. She is always naked. Despair has a cold, quietly intelligent manner. She has 
                        a habit of carving her flesh with a hooked ring that she wears, which is also her sigil. The second aspect is the one that appears throughout the 
                        main storyline. Despair's text is normal in a balloon with ragged-waved edges. She often associates with Desire, but unlike Desire she was fond of Destruction.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Delirium</td>
                    <td>The youngest of the Endless, Delirium appears as a young girl whose form changes the most frequently of any of the Endless, based on the random fluctuations of her 
                        temperament. She has wild multicolored hair and eccentric, mismatched clothes. Her only permanent physical characteristic is that one of her eyes is emerald green 
                        (usually the right side) splattered with silver flecks and the other pale blue (usually the left side), but even those sometimes switch between left and right. Her sigil 
                        is an abstract, shapeless blob of colors. Her speech is portrayed in standard graphic novel block-caps, characterized by wavy, unpredictable orientation and a multi-colored 
                        gradient background. She was once known as Delight, but some traumatic event (of which even Destiny does not know the particulars) caused her to change into her current role. 
                        Her sigil as Delight was a flower.</td>
