    GetTimesheetsByEmployeeId_ReturnsListOfAllTimesheetsForEmployee
Expected output:
    GetTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1) returns a list of 2 timesheets
Actual output:
    GetTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1) was returning a list of 1 timesheet

    Replaced "if (reader.Read())" with "while (reader.Read())" in GetTimesheetsByEmployeeId so all results are processed.

Test that demonstrates problem:
    GetTimesheetsByProjectId_ReturnsListOfAllTimesheetsForProject
Expected output:
    GetTimesheetsByProjectId(1) returns a list of 3 timesheets
Actual output:

How did you fix this bug?
    Modified the WHERE clause in the SQL used by GetTimesheetsByProjectId to filter on project_id rather than employee_id.

Bug 3

Test that demonstrates problem:
    UpdatedTimesheetHasExpectedValuesWhenRetrieved
Expected output:
    GetTimesheet(1) returns a timesheet with IsBillable set to false (after updating that value with updateTimesheet)
Actual output:
    GetTimesheet(1) was returning a timesheet with IsBillable set to true
How did you fix this bug?
    Added is_billable to the list of fields being updated by the SQL in UpdateTimesheet.

Bug 4

Test that demonstrates problem:
    GetBillableHours_ReturnsCorrectTotal
Expected output:
    GetBillableHours(2, 2) returns 0
Actual output:
    GetBillableHours(2, 2) was returning 2.0 (the total of all timesheets, not just the billable ones)
How did you fix this bug?
    Added "is_billable = 1" to the WHERE clause of the SQL used by GetBillableHours.
