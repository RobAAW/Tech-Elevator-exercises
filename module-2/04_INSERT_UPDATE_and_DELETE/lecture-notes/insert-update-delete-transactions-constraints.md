# INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, transactions, constraints, and referential integrity

## Overview of session

In this lecture, you'll introduce the SQL used to modify data in a relational database, and discuss the mechanisms that help avoid problems when making those modifications.

## Session objectives

- Write INSERT statements
- Write UPDATE statements
- Write DELETE statements
- Understand the benefits of referential integrity and how it can cause INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs to fail
- Understand how constraints limit the changes that can be made
- Understand what transactions are and the SQL needed to make use of them

## Instructor notes

1. **INSERT**
	- INSERT adds new records to the database.
	- Primary keys are often automatically generated rather than being set explicitly.
	- The values of the records being added can be supplied in a VALUES clause, or be the result of a subquery.
	- *Go through the examples in the lecture code for INSERT.*
		- Note that the city and park tables only allow one decimal place for area. If there's time, you could demonstrate how values with more decimal places get rounded when inserted.

2. **UPDATE**
	- UPDATE modifies existing records.
	- The WHERE clause determines which records are updated. **Without it, all records are updated.**
	- The previous value of a field can be used to calculate the new value.
	- Multiple fields can be updated by a single query.
	- *Go through the examples in the lecture code for UPDATE.*

3. **DELETE**
	- DELETE removes records.
	- The WHERE clause determines which records are deleted. **Without it, all records are deleted.**
	- *Go through the examples in the lecture code for DELETE.*

4. **Referential Integrity**
	- We've learned that databases can have relationships established between tables using primary and foreign keys.
	- **Referential integrity** ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent.
	- INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs can all fail if the change violates the database's referential integrity.
	- Often, the order in which changes are made is important. For example, a record with a foreign key must first be deleted before the associated record in another table can be deleted.
	- *Go through the examples in the lecture code for Referential Integrity.*

5. **Constraints**
	- A **constraint** is associated with a table and defines criteria that the column data must comply with.
	- Types of Constraints:
		1. **NOT NULL** - requires a value to be specified for the column
		2. **DEFAULT** - provides a default value for the column
		3. **UNIQUE** - prevents using a value already in the table for that column
		4. **CHECK** - specifies acceptable values that can be entered in the column
	- Two other constraints are used to establish referential integrity:
		1. **PRIMARY KEY** (PK) - includes NOT NULL and UNIQUE
		2. **FOREIGN KEY** (FK) - requires values to exist as PKs, and limits deletion of the PK row if FK row exists
	- *Go through the examples in the lecture code for Constraints.*

6. **Transactions**
	- If we have multiple INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements and want them to be considered as an *all or nothing*, then we consider it a **transaction**.
	- A **transaction** is a single unit of work. When it is successful, it must be **committed**. If an error is encountered at any point, it must be cancelled or **rolled back**.
	- When a transaction is in progress, other queries of the database normally won't see the changes being made until the transaction has been committed.
	- Ask students why this might be important using the example of a bank transfer. Some possible answers:
		- We wouldn't want funds to be withdrawn from one account and never deposited to the other account.
		- If the deposit fails, the withdrawal should also fail (and vice-versa).
		- Simultaneous requests to transfer to different accounts should be handled one after the other (and should not create money).
	- *Go through the examples in the lecture code for Transactions.*
